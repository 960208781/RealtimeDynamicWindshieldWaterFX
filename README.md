What is this?
This is an FX for Unity for recreating the water drops when hitting a car windshield and its wipers. This FX is inspired by the amazing FX of the Drive Club video game. This FX is originally made in 2015 by Dan, with a help of Eric Chadwick and Obscura from PolyCount for AroundTheGround: Kish Simulator, A Unity3D passion project.

After sometime I decided to share it as I stopped developing it. Make this FX the world's best one for the community if possible!!
Each script has comments and guidelines. Hopefully, editing and modifing this Unity asset is easy for you. Regards, Dan.

Real-time Windshield Waterdrops FX
===================


This is an FX for Unity for recreating the water drops when hitting a car windshield and its wipers. 
This is inspired by the amazing FX of the *Drive Club* video game. Originally it was made in 2015 by me, with the help of Eric Chadwick and Obscura from PolyCount for [AroundTheGround: Kish Simulator](http://AroundTheGround.tk), A Unity3D passion project.

After sometime I decided to share it as I stopped developing it. Make this FX the world's best one for the community if possible!!
Each script has comments and guidelines. Hopefully, editing and modifying this Unity asset is easy for you. Regards.

How it works
-------------

When you play the scene, you notice water drops react to the acceleration and a set of imaginary windshield wipers.  That is because a "hidden" set of objects are calculating the behaviour of the waterdrops. In the below text, you'll learn how this "hidden" system is working.

> **The way it works**

> [1] There is a system that is stationary and simulates the water drops, the water drops are white spheres
> [2] A Camera records the behaviour of the white spheres and prjects them on the car's windshield
> [3] Unlike the car, the system is stationary, but it reads the G-Force of the car to simulate the water drops realistically.

### Support this asset!

  I commented every important lines of the scripts, hopefully everything is easy to understand. Have fun improving this asset for the community.
  This asset was made for my [Around The Ground](http://AroundTheGround.TK) passion project, You may check it out if you like.
